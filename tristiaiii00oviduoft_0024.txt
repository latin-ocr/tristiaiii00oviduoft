[Abridgcd from the M.A. Prospectus.]

Branch 1.: claudet—The course embraces papers on Authors ;
History; Greek, Latin and English Prose Composition; and Gram-
mar, together with trial passages for Unseen Translation.

The amount of time devoted to each of these subj ects is proportionate
to the imperuim-e attached to it at the examination.

The papers on Authors are 110 in number. Of these, 21 are
assigned to Latin From-writers, 29 to Latin Poets, 6 to Greek His·
toriam, 9 to Greek Oratore, 16 to Greek Philomphers, and 29 to
Greek Poets.

Each author-papst deals, on the average, with about 1‚500 lines of
verse or a somewhat larger amount of prose. Difficult and important
passages are set for the student to translate in writing, and his version
is revised by the tutor. Lists of notabilia, suitable sor revision before
the examination, are given, and the notes of the edition selected aa a
text-book supplemented. Lists of rare words, and miscellaneous hints
on subject-matter. metre, &c., also form part of these papers. In
the case of some authors, of which no handy edition has hitherto ap-
peared in England, fuller notes accompany the lesson-papers.

For a detailed scheme of the course, see MA. prospectus.
