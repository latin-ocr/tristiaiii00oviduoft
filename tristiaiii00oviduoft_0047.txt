INTRODUCUON. 11

Each pentameter consists of five feet, made up of two
full feet followed by a long syllable, and then two dactyls
followed by a single syllable. The scheme of metre is

accordingly

Ι11 the pentameter the caesura may only be after the
long syllable which follows the second foot.

In the first half of the pentameter much more variety
is allowed than in the second half. In the second half
the two feet must be dactyls‚ spondees not being admissi-
ble, and no elision is allowable.

The last word, as a rule, is a dissyllable (⁹3ss a tri-
syllable in this position is not allowable‚ bnt we sometimes
find a final word of four or even five syllables. · The last
word is, as a rule, either a noun or a verb, but occasionally
a pronomina] adjective and some other parts of speech are
met with. In the first part of the pentameter, on the
other hand, you can have either a spondee or a dactyl for
either of the first two feet, you ean have elisions. and the
half line may end with a word of any number of syllables,
and with any part of speech.

The elegiac metre is much smoother and more easy-
flowing than the hexameter. Elisions are much rarer, and
the dactyl is more frequently used. It will be seen that
there are far fewer metrical licenses in the Tristia than
there are in the DIetamm-plzoses. The only metrical pecu-
liarities to which allusion need be made here, in addition
to the ordinary contracted perfect forms (amasti, adam-
asset, prostrasse), are :—

(1) El. IV„ 1. 8. “ Non prosit potius, chZerzom &besse
potest,” where there is an elision in the second half of the
pentameter3 but see note on the line.

(2) El. XIV.‚ l. 36. “Et longo periit arida facta situ‚'’
where final it of third singular perfect is lengthened before
a vowel.

3. Ε1.ΧΠ.,1. 2. “Longior antiquis visa Maeotis hiems,''
where the diphthong ae is scanned as a short vowel. In
our text the word Maeotis has been altered into Tomitis.
