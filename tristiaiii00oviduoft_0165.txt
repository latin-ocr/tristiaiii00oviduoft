ovm's TRISTIA, 111„ xl. 17

δτι-ονε, for on the swift-flying steel there is a poison which
has been dipped upon it. What they cannot carry or drag
away with themselves they destroy, and the hostile tire
bums the innocent hutS. Then‚ too, when thero is
peace, they tremble with sear of wan: nor does anyone

as a lamb when surrounded by mountain wolx'eS, thus I am
terrified‚ hedged in on all sides by war-like races, the enemy
almost pressing on my side.

15. Supposing it is but a slight punishment that l am
deprived of my dear wife, of my count-ry, ancl of my
pledges of affection (my children)—supposing that I am
enduring no woes except the mere wrath of Caesar—is the
mere wrath of Caesar too little of au evil for me} And
