althou h the power-ful alone are able to confer benefit, the
powe ul man, should he not prefer to confer a benefit, cau
do the most injuries. The lowered sailyard escapes the
wintry smnus, and broad sails cause more sear thau small
oneo. Seest thou how the light cork floats on the. top oi
the wave, although the heavy weight siuks together with
itself the nets tied to itl 11 1, who am now advising‚ had
received this advice lwforc‚1)ercl1ance 1 should now bv in
the city in which 1 ought ω have been. While 1 lived
with thee, while the light breem»v bore me, my bark sped
over quiet water& He who falls ou a level soil (yet this

thy gentle goodneSS‚ and through thy loyalty which will

any part be lightened. Live without envy‚ and without
glory go through thy quiet yearS, and join to thyself the
friendship of thy equals 3 and love the name of thy Naso :
