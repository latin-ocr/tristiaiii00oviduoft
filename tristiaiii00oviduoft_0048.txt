12 ovm's missu.

following are the most important, but they are nearly all
subject to exceptions :—

(l) A diphthong or contractet] syllable is long, e.g.,
accceps, ιτῠμιῖΙ (ᾗ τ coligit).

(2) The former of two vowels not forming a dipl1th‹›ng
is short, e.g., μναῖ-ἴτω.

(3) A vowel is long when it is followed (l) by two
eonsonants or x or z, whether in the same word or
different words; or (2) by aj in the smne word.

(4) A vowel by nature short becomes either long or
short when it comes before 3, mute followed by a liquid,

e.g., tenl'sslnw ,· bnt qn and qm make a preceding vowel long.

(5) Finul syllables of words ending in a, i, ο, τι, as, es,
(ιε, and c are long.

(6) Final syllables of words ending in e, n, r, l, ‹1‚t,
is, us, :md ys are short.

(7) Monosyllables are generally long.

(8) Final α in nom. and acc. is short.

Final is is long in dat. and abl. plurals, in 2nd sing.
pres. of verbs of the 4th conjugation.

Final us is short except in the nom. and acc. pl„
and gen. sing. of the 4th declension‚ aud in fem.
nouus like virius.

A vowel at the end of a word is elided before a vowel at
the beginning of the next word.

The syllables am, em, im, om, and um at the end of a
word are elided before 3 vowel at the beginning of the
next word.

The letter Ῐι has no effect as a consonant in lengthening
a preceding vowel. A final vowel is elided before a word
beginning with h, thus atque hos.

lt is unusual to have a word of more than three syllables
at the end of a hexameter ; the last word generally
consists of either two or three syllables. A monosyllable
at the end of 3, line, e.g., ridiculus mus, vulmflcus sus. is
not reckoned elegant 3 but this remark does not apply to
3, line ending in est preceded by 3. word which could itself
have ended the line, e.g., αΤιιεᾶ Est, ονέᾶύᾶ est, or, in 3, penta·
meter, mea est.
