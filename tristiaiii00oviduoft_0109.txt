noras, '73

26. licet: impers. verb, governing dat. of the person. Pudet, poenitet,
taedet, piget, miseret govern acc. of the person feeling, and
gen. of the thing which causes the feeling.

27. mihi = a me,· the dative is sometimes (and especially after a
passive participle) thus used in poetry instead of a and the
abl. of agent following a passive verb.

28. quaeque lacu, &C.: cf. El. x.‚ Π. 26—36. Instead of non, some
editions read vizo.

aquae ε supply sentiuntur after this word.

30. bubulcus: a ploughman (= arator) differs from pastor or armen-
tarius = herdsman.

33. dictaque salute ε salutem alicui decere = to greet any one. The
ordinary heading of a letter was “(Cicero) or (Caesar) SD. or
S.P.D.” = salutem dicit or salutem plurimam dicit.

34. veniat: subjunctive because it is an indirect question depending
on quaeram.

35. mirggn ni ε. used as a kind of adverb = doubtless, without doubt.
. mmzrwm.

36. ararit. The reading here is doubtful: ararit is either (l) the
fut. perf. ind. = he will have ploughed‚ it will be found that
he has ploughed3 ον (2) the perf. subj., mirum sit πί ararit :2
it would be wonderful if he has not ploughed. There is
another reading, araret, and the construction would then be
merum (esset) ni araret.

37. rarus navita: the adjective 'rarus is here used almost like an
adverb raro. Cf. the use of primus.

orba: orbus, and adjectives signifying fulness, want, &c.‚ govern
the ablative, e.g., plenus, dit-es, nudus. Cf. IL, 11, and IV„ 27.

40. certe gratior hujus erit: probably we must supply vooe, (( cer-
tainly the voice or sound of the latter (ie, of Latin) will be
more welcome.''

41. fas. · fas is strictly divine laW, as opposed to jus, or human law, ·
and fas est generally means ((11) is right or allowable.'’ But
occasionally it means nothi ιρι more than potest: it is possible,

as here Cf. El. v.‚ l. 27, where fas may mean either (1) law-
fin, allowable, or (2') possible

freti 2 the straits of the Thracian Bosporus or Hellespont.

Propontidos : the Propontis was the Sea of Marmora, between
the Hellespont and the Thracian Bosporus. In coming from
the AEgaean you must pass through Propontis before getting
into the Pontus Euxinus.

42. certo Noto : with a steady south-wind, which would be required
by a boat sailing northwards. ·
