fora Caesaris 2 there is some doubt as to the meaning of these
two words, According to some, it is (1) the forum of C.Julius
Caesar and the forum of Augustus Caesar3 according to othe1 s
it is (2) the forum of C. Julius Caesar alone3 but probably it

is (3) the sorum of Augustus alone.

Interpretation (1) would require Caesarum for Caesaris.
The plural sora is here used instead of the sing. sorum, a very
common idiom iu Ovid. Cf. pectora, IV. 69 and II. 10;
corpora, 111. 39 and VIII. 24; corda, ΙΙ. 163 vultus, VIII. 9 3

‘nostrae animae, ΙΙΙ. 59.

was a statue of Minerva, supposed to have faUen from

13.c., devoted himself especially to giving his city a constitu·
tion and a body of laws. He instituted the, pontiffs, augurs,
flamens, and vestal virgins. The name Numa is probably
connected with the Greek νόμος, law.

31. Palati : the last syllable of Palatii is here contracted on accounts
of the metre. Horace almost, invariably uses the contracted
form, but Ovid, as a rule, uses the uncontracted. The
Palatium was one of the seven hills of Rome, and was tlte firsn
to be built upon. Augustus erected his residence her-³, and
also built, a temple to Apollo, which was used as a public
library.
