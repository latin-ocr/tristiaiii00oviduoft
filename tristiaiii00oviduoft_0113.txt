Curae is the dative commonly called the predicative dative.
This dative is usually a semi-abstract substantive, always in
the singular number, and without any attribute, except some-
times a simple quantitative adjective, e.9., magnus, minor.- it
expresses that which a thing or person serves as or occasions,
e.9., puer mihi solacio est, esitio est mare nautis = the boy is

the work was in the hands of one of his friends, and to this
fact we owe the preservation of the poem. See the intro-
duction to this edition, which should be carefully read by the
student.

El. xii„ 1. 14, we have a Getico litore, while in l. 16 we have
