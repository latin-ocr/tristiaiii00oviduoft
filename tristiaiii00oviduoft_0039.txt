§L—LIFE AND woRKs or ovin.

P. Ovuurs NASO was born at Sulmo, about 90 miles from
Rome, on March 20, B.c. 43. He was descended from an
equestrian family, which, though ancient, was not
favoured with too much wealth. Accordingly he could
not indulge his inclination to devote himself solely and

and qualify himself for the bar. The death of his
brother Lucius at the early age of 20 left the father with
only one son to provide for, and he at length yielded to
the desires of the young poet, and allowed him to go to
Athens (which corresponded in those times to our Oxford
and Cambridge Universities) for the purpose of com-
pleting his education. Ovid then travelled through Asia
and Sicily, and, on his return to Rome, perhaps practised
as an advocate for a little while. He did not enter the
Senate, but became one of the Triumviri Capita les, certain
officers who decided petty disputes between slaves and
persons of inferior rank, and who looked after the prisons
and superintended the execution of criminals. He was
next made one of the Centum-iri, who tried matters re-
lating to wills and sometimes crimina] cases, and in course
of time was promoted to be one of the Decemviri, who
assembled and presided over the court of the Centumvz'ri.
After passing through these offices he gave up all public
life and began that series of love poems which brought
him so much fame and also so much sorrow. His facility
for writing verse was extraordinary3 he found it much
easier to write graceful and elegant lines than to revise
