NOTES. 37

66. optaret: there is another reading optarat = optaverat. The subj.
is used here after the relative qum, and conveys the idea of

indegeniteness with respect to what books he is sorry to have
wri n.

68. sancto ε the spot is called holy to imply that the presence of this
“stranger book’' profanes it. It is in the dative, governed
by praepositus. There is another reading me for e, which
would make sedibus, dat. after prenejnosw'tus, and loco abl.

69. altera templa: another temple. The plural here is perhaps used
for the sing, cf. Fora Caesarie, l. 25, antlc1.r.-wli1?‹:1. templu, l. 60.
The plural may be used because the temple is regarded as
consisting of more than one building3 but the other word for
temple is aedes, -is, f.‚ which is regarded as consisting of one
chamber or apartment; aedes in the plural generally means
a house, as consisting of several apartments.

It is doubtful which is the temple here alluded to; some
say the temple of Hercules, some the temple of Venus Victrix,
and others say the portico of Octavia near the theatre of
Marcellus, where Augustus had erected a library.

71. 'libellis: libellus, -ε, m., is the diminutive form of liter, a book.

72. Libertas: the temple of Liberty was built by Asinius Pollio, a
distinguished orator, historian, and soldier (B.C. Ttl—AAE. 4),
and friend of Augustus. In this temple he founded the first
public library.

73-4. The books are exiled as well as their author.

redundat: redundo, from re or recl = again, and unda, a wave3
= to stream back over, superabound, redound.

75. olim: from olle or ollas, an old form of ille, and locative termina-
tion im = illo tempore, and has three chief meanings: (1) at that
(past) time = once upon a time3 (2) at times (from the idea
that what has happened once happens often); (3) at some
future time, cf. quandocumque, l. 57.

¹76. evictus: the e denotes thoroughness. completeness.
79. statio publica: i.e., a position in the public library.
80. delituisse z from delitesco, de and latesco, lateo, to be hid. Verbs

ending in -sco generally imply to begin to do something, and
are called inceptive or inchoative verbs.

II.

1. Scythiam: a large district comprising the SE. parts of Europe,
between the Carpathian Mountains and the Don. This was
the meaning in the time of Herodotus 3 but by writers in the
time of the Roman Empire Scythia included N .Asia west of
the Volga, extending to India.
