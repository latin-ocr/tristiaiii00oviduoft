72 TRISTIA 111.‚ xii.

13. gemma: the first meaning of this word is (1) bud3 hence, from
the colour and shape, it was applied to (2) a gem or precious
stone ; hence anything made of a precious stone, e.9. (3) a cup
or goblet‚ and (4 a signet, and (5) ornament, beauty.

14. namfprocuL &(3. The vine only fiourishes where there is plenty
o sun.

17. otia nunc istic ε *istic = at Rome. Otia : there were fixed holidays
or festivals at Rome in April and May, and the thought of the
ἱῗῗὲἱὶἓξεῗῡ Rome makes the poet's banishment more solitar-y

18. cedunt: yield‚ give place to, governing the dat. ludis.

garrula bella fori: the cases in the law—courts. On public
holidays (which were called dies nefasti) the law-courts were
shut. The days on which the courts were open were called
dies fasti.
19. levibus armis ζ this probably alludes to the Ludus Trojae per-
formed by young men on horseback‚ said to have been in-
vented by Aeneas.

21. oleo: the Romans used to anoint themselves with oil, both
before taking their exercises in the Campus Martius and
before bathing.

22. Virgine aqua : by virgin water‚—a fountain which had been dis-
covered by some virgin near the Campus Martius.

23. scena viget: the laeli were divided into ludi circenses and the
ludi scenici ,· the former have been described in ss. 19—22,
and now allusion is made to the latter.

studiis: with zeal, partisanship; each actor has his own special
admirers and partisans.
favor: applause.

24. There were three fora at Rome—(1) forum Romanorum, (2)
forum Caesaris, (3) forum Augusti3 and there were three
theatres, called respectively the theatre of (1) Pompey, (2)
Marcellus, and (3) Statilius.

terna: the distributive is here perhaps used by poetic license
for tria, the cardinal number. Distributives are used instead
of cardinal numbers with nouns which have no singular.
Here, perhaps, a distributive is used because each forum has
its place taken by a theatre. Cf. El. viii„ 1. 34.

25. Ο quater, 800. ε lit„ “O happy four times, O happy so often as it
is not possible to count is he who can enjoy the City which is
not forbidden to him.'' Notice the interjectional acc. beatum ‚-
cf. me miserum.

In English we talk of being thrice happy, but not of being
four times happy. So we say, “ I prefer a thousand deaths,''
where the Romans said malo sescenties mori.
