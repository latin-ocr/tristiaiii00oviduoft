and correct inconsistencies in what he had previously
written. He was married three times, on the two first
occasions to please his parents, but in each of these two
marriages he soon obtained a divorce; he seems to have
Ioved his third wife sincerely, and he had by her a
daughter Perilla. His chief works were :—

1. Amorum Libri HL, principally addressed to Corinna,
a mistress of the poet.

2. The lloroz'des, or love-letters, for the most part from
the heroines of mythology to their faithless husbands.

3. Ars Amatoria, 01· De Arte Amcmdi„ written about
css. 2, when he was more than forty years old. The first
two books of the Ars Amatoria are supposed to instruct
111611, and the last book women. then Ovid was banished,
as described later on, this poem was removed from the
public librat-ies by the command of Augustus.

4. Remmia Amol-233, suggesting remedies for the violence
of love.

5. illeiammpswseou Libri XV„ devoted to the mytho-
logie-al accounts of transformations caused by the love,
Jealousy‚ and vengeance of divine heroes and heroineS‚
starting from the Creation and reaching down to the
time of Augustus, the last transformation described being
that of the Emperor into a star. The skill with
which 1116 distinct episodes are connected together claims
1116 highest admiration. Ovid's principal model was
probably 1116 Ἑτεροιούμενα of Nicander. The first two or
three books of the Metamorphoses, in spite of their faults,
abound with beautiful passages which are poetry in the
truest sense, and similar poetica] passages of equal excel·
lence are met with, though less frequently, in the other
books, e.9., the description of the Cave of Sleep in the
eleventh book, which for vigour of fancy has not been
surpassed by any poet. It may be interesting to‘add
that Ovid was engaged in refining and polishing up
this work when 116 was driven into banishment3 in
the hurry and vexation of his ssight he burnt the manu-
script, but, luckily‚ some copies had already been dis-
tributed among his friends, and the poem was thus
preserved.
