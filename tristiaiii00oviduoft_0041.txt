6. Fastorum Libri ΧΙΙ., of which only the first six
remain. This work was incomplete at the time of the
poet's banishment, ΑΛ). 8, and he must have done the
greatest part of it at Tomi. It is probable that he began
writing this patriotic work in order to recommend himself
to the Emperor, who might make him the court-poet now
that Horace and Vergil were dead. His banishmem,
however, put an end to any hopes he might have enter-

reason, the fact remains that towards the end of the yeai
A. D. 8 Ovid was suddenly commanded to betake himself to
Tomi, a town on the Euxine, near the mouth of the
Danube, at the extreme limit of the empire. This banish-
ment was not, however an milium, but a 7ele9at710, the
latter being milder than the former3 by a releqatio he
neither lost his citizenship nor deprived himself of
