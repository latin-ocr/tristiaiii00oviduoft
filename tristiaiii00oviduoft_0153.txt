mcely to be revived by pouriug ‹lowu wine, let some-
οπο announce that my mistress has come hither, 1 will rise,
and the ho o οἱ seeing thee will be the cause οἱ my strength.

25. So am doubtful of my life, while thou, perchance,
knowing naught of me, art passing there a pls-:sant time.
Thou art not passing a pleasant time, 1 assert: this is
clear, dearest wife, that without me thy time can only pass
sadly. Still, if my lot has completed the years it was
destined to complete, and if the limit of my life is so quickly
at haud, what a great kiufflxesz, ye mighty gods, it would
have been to spare one about to die, so that, at least, 1
should be buried in my native ground. Esther my punish·
ment should have been put off until the time of my ‹lt-ath,
or my ‹leath should have been hastened aml cenue before
my ssight. A full citizen, latelyl could well have given up
this light of day, but, as it is, my life has been given me in
order to «lie as an exile. Then 1 um to die so fur off in
unknown shoreS, and my dooxu shall l›e mazle bitter by the
place itself. My body is not to wear itself axx-ay on my
accustomed bed, and there shall he no one to lameut for me
when Ι am laid out in death. And no short time shall be
added to my life while the tears of my mistress sall on my
face: nor shall 1 give dying commannis, nor shall any
friendly hand at my last cry close my failiug eyes, But a
barbarian land shall cover this head of mine, unwept,
without a funeral, aud without the honour of a tomb.
When thou hearest this, wilt thou be troubled in all thy
mind, and wilt thou st-rike thy faithful breast with trembling
hand‘l wilt thou. stretching in vain thy arms towards
these parts, call upon the empty name of thy hapless
husband? Abstain‚ however, from rending thy clmeks,
aud tear not thy hair: this is not the first time I shall have
been snatched from thee, my light. Thiuk that I perished
at the time when I had to give up my country : that death
was earlier and more burdensome. for me. Now, if per-
chance thou art able (but thou art not able, O best of wives),
rejoiee at the ending of my many missortunes by my death.
As far as thou art able, lessen, by bearing them with a brave
beart, the evils in which thy heart now for a long while has
boen well experienced.
