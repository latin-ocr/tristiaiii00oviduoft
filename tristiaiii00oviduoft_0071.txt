vereor 2 remember the curious idiom with regard to this word—
vereo‘t· ‘ne veniat = I sear he may come3 vereor ut veniat = Ι
sear he may not come. The explanation probably is, that
vereor originally did not mean to sear, but to take care, see
(cf. Gr. ὃράω), and so ‘vereor ne veniat = 1 am taking care that
he may not come, i.e., I fear he may come, and rerem· ut-
veniat = I am taking care that he may come, i.e.‚ Ι fear he
may not come.

In place of vereorque some editions read venerorque.
