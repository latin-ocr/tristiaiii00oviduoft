Nomas, 41

ut foret: the ut depends on sic, “ so wild that, &0³³ ·

amentis: distinguish dmens, mad, from (bnans, a loveror loving3
and amentum, -i, n., a strap, thong; amens, mad as applied to
every kind of passionate excitemen323 iit-scmus, diseased in
mind; ecoco‘rs or vecors = without mind.

deficiam : subjunctive after conditional si. Nuntiet could be sub-
junctive after conditional si, or else a kind of imperative. This
latter construction would explain the use of the indicat. erit.
Resuryam can either be subjunctive or future indicative.
Instead of deficiam, suppressaque, there is another reading,
deficiat suppresso,

erit: if we regard this sentence as continuons, we should take
‘resurgam to be the subjunctive, and expect to read sit instead
of erit. The conditional sentence, however, seems discon-
tinued, and is followed by an imper.‚ which is itself followed
by a graphio indicative.

illic: at Rome, where Ι long 'to be.

nostri: this is properly the genitive of the neuter adjective noster
used substantively. Nostri = of our nature, interests, condi-
tion3 nostrum is the true plural of 7208, and means simply of us,
of our number. Thus “none of us'' = 'nemo nostrum (parti-
tive) 3 but “ our mind is the best part of us '³ (i.e.‚ ofour nature)
= nostri melior pars animus est. The rule is, use nostrum,
vestrum for the partitive genitive3 nostri, vestri in other cases.
(When, however, omnium precedes the genitive of nos 01· vos
you must always use the um form.)

nescia : governs the genitive on analogy with words like sagam,
impotens, impatiens. See IL, 9.

tempus agis: 'tempus agere is the regular phrase for “to pass
time away.’

finis: this word is an exception to the rule that nouns of the
3rd declension ending in -is are feminine. It is, however,
occasionally feminine in the sing. in ante and post-classical
authors, and also in poetry ; in the plural it is always masc.

erat Ξ notice the graphio indicative, where we should rather have
expected the conditional subjunctive.
parcere governs the dative,

humo : humus, like alvus, colus, domus, and mamas, is feminine,
although the rule is that all nouns of the 21‘1d declension end-
ing in -us are masculine. See infra, VHI„ 2.

vel: this word is connected with volo, Ι wish3 vel vel = either ’
or, i.e.‚ whichever you choose.

. praecepisset: from praecipio :prae capio, to take beforehand‚

= antecwpio, to anticipate.
