roms. 55

27. breve: understand eat after this word, and also after tutum.
Nec breve = and it is no short tale. There is another read·
ing, nec leve = and it is no light task.

82. tempus: reformidat is transitive and governs tempus in aco-
37. alium: sc. locum.

absim is in the subj. because of the idea of purpose in quo.

Quo is generally used instead of ut when followed by a com·
parative adverb or adjective.

88. suburbana: Let Pontus, where I am at present, be reckoned as
a mere suburb of the city compared to the place where Ι am
willing to be banished if Ι am not now giving a true account.

VII.
1. salutatum 2 the supine after rade, a verb of motion.

perarata: peroro, lit. = to plough through3 hence = to scratch
letters with a style on a waxen tablet, to write.

Perillam: Perilla is taken by some to be the daughter of Ovid,
but the language employed shows that this is improbable,
since the poet would neither address his daughter in words of
such distant admiration, nor pass over his wife by merelJ
alluding to her as the dulcis mater of Perilla.

2. litera: litera in the sing. is generally a letter of the alphabs-t,
and the plural literae is alone used in prose for an epistle.
The sing. is here used by a poetical licence. For the reverse
process, see 1.‚ 27.

4. Pieridasque : the Pierides were the Muses, so called from Pieria,
a. district of South Eastern Macedonia, sacred to the Muses.

Libros Pieridasque suas, may perhaps be a hendiaciys =

the books of her Muse. By a hendiaclys is meant the em-

ployment of two words coordinated instead of an expre<si0n

in which one qualifies the other grammatically. Thus, pateris

libamus et auro = we offer libations in cups and gold, i.e., in
cups of gold.

. aget, scierit Ζ notice the future tense.

6. nec mora: “ nor was there delay,'' used almost as an adverb or
adverbial sentence = without delay.
quid = propter quid, cur, why. The order is, requiret quid
venias, quidve aqam.

9. reverti: the authors of the ante-Augustan period make the
perfect forms only from the active root ; but in the present
tenses, the active form is rare. Here reverti is the present
inf. pass„ depending on dices, and having for its subject me
understood.
