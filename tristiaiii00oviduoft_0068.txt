NOTES.

ψ

Ι.

. exulis: Ovid was at this time an exile at Tomi, on the Euxine,

whither he had been banished by the emperor, probably for
some political reason. The cause generally, but wrongly‚
assigned was the publication of his Ars Amatoria.

. pudori: this dative is often called the dative of advantage or

disadvantage——“lest I should be for a shame to thee,’' so
puer mihi solatio est = the boy is a solace to me. See note
on El. xiv„ line 18.

. amare ζ a reference to his Ars Amatoria and Remedium Amoris.
. haec = talis. Is is much more commonly used in this sense

than hic.
domini τ the master, owner, or writer of the book.

. dissimulare : dissimulare = to hide a thing, to pretend it is not

what it is ; simulare = to feign a thing to be what it is not.

. viridi: green age = yonthful days, a metaphor from the bright

green leaves of a tree.

. sero: εένο adV. = late ; εένο, sevi, satum, 3, to sow3 εὲνο, serui,

sertum, 3, to twine.

odit : the perfect οᾱ i is used in a present sense, so the pluperf.
oderat is used as an imperfect. Coepi, I have begun, is like
odi in having no present tense.

. inspice quid portem: see what I carry, i.e., see what my con-

tents are.
triste : the name given to these books is Tristia.

temporibus: frequently used, as here, with the meaning of
danqerous or distressful circumstances ,- e.g.‚ tempus swmmahm
reipublicae, “the State’s djrest extremity.''

conveniente: convenio governs the dative, like pareo, parco,
invideo, indulyeo, noceo, placeo, resisto, faveo.

clauda quod, 8⁶0. : this refers to the metre in which the Tristia
is written, zze. Elegiae. Just as a man is said to halt when
his legs are not of equal length, so this metre is called halt-ing,
because ther-e is an alternation of a longer and a shorter line,
a hexameter being followed by a pentameter.
