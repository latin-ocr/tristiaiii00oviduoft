constancy of his friend, who does not attempt to hide hi>-
friendship‚ although it was not of long standing. If this
friend’s advice had been followed, or if Ovid had confided
to him that on account of which he has been banished, he
(Ovid) would now not have been suffering this punishment.
He begs his friend to try and pacify Augustus, and at
least attempt to get the place of his banishment changed.

ELEGY VII. The poet advises a lady named Perilla (by
some people supposed to be his daughter) not to be deterred
by his unlucky example from cultivating the Muses. Let
her rather take warning, and avoid what he ought to have
avoided. He himself still pursues his poetical studies,
and by them hopes to attain immortality. Beauty fadeS,
but the works of a poet last for ever.

ELEGY VIII. Like Elegies V. and VI., this poem de-
scribes the hardship and troubles of the poet's exile, and
his entreaties to Augustus to revoke the sentence of
banishment, or else, at least, change the place of exile.

ELEGY IX. This poem describes how Grecian cities
formerly founded colonies on the Getic coast, and how the
name Tomi was derived from the crime of Medea, who
cut up her brother’s limbs and scattered them about the
fields, so as to delay the pursuit of her father.

ELEGY X. The poet depicts the miseries of his exile and

Danube freezes, how the barbarian Scythian hordes, with
their archers and cavalry, cross over the ice, lay waste the
country, and take captive the inhabitants, who at this time
of the year are always in fear and alarm, no matter whether
the enemy is actually coming against them or not.

ELEGY XI. The poet inveighs against an unnamed
person who has exulted over his misfortunes‚ and has
dared to reopen his painful wounds. Do not forget
the tale of Phalaris, how the contriver and inventor of
the engine of torture was its first victim. Remember,
too, the vicissitudes of human fortune, and let oblivion
cover my fault, and be assured nothing could exceed the
misery of my present lot.

ELEGY XII. He enumerates the various pleasures of
returning spring amid which time is past at Rome, and of
