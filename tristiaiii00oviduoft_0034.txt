The Schvoobmaster, of May 2lst, 1887. sant—“This series of γ
Gnidon to the Examinations of London Universitywillpmve extremely
servieeable to candidate-s. They are—as Gnidon should be-con-
fessedly limited in scope, but they give just the kind of da'rection and
advice that a student needs, pointing out the most reliable, helpful,
and recent sources of information, and plainly indicating points of
special importance. In the Mathematical Guides for Matnculafion
and the Intermediate, the syllabus is divided up into weekly or fort-
m'ghtly portiom, and all the handbooks give sets of examination
questions, with solutions to the exercises in mathematics. Πηλῆι up
in a useful and workmanlike fashion, the books give abundant moi
of sound scholarship specialised and applied to the requirements of
the London examinationes. Speaking from the reconection of our
own undergraduate days, it is painfully evident that such works as
these would have saved us many an hour’s hard and profitless grind.
We can umeservedly commend the series, believing that such aide,
supplemented by judicious reaching in weak subjecte, may place a
Lotgdon ⁹degree within reaeh of a considerable number of our
rea ers.'

The Educational Journal, of the same date, says:—⁴‘These bookfl
save the student an immense labour, and, being from the pens of
professional scholare, the information is not only eorreotly stated, but
easily understood.”

The Sekool Board Chroniele says :—-“ The University Correspond·
ence College Tutorial Guides have gained a great reputation.”

ι The Educational Times says :—“ The Tutorial Series is the best of
its kind.”
