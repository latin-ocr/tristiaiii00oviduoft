viz., a hard level surface of ice.

Remember that mons, 190728, and fons are maso., being excep-
tions to the rule that nouns of the 3rd decl. ending in s
impure are fem.

credar: verbs which govern the dative in the active can, as a
rule, only be used impersonally in the passive3 thus, “ Ι spare
him '' = parco illi, but “ Ι am spared '' = mihi parcitur. The
personal use of credor in the passive is, however, found several
times in the poets ; cf. IV.‚ 3.

consistere : consisto, (1) to stand still, (2) to set, become hard.

testa: testo. = tosta, from torreo, to burn = (1) bus-ned clay, a
briok, (2) baked earthenware, a jar, (3) a shell covering. The
second meaning is used in line 23, and the third meaning is
used here = a slippery shell or covering of ice. There is
another reading, crusta = orust, but this emendation is not
necessary.

. udo: the foot did not become wet, although it touched the

surface of the wave.

crimen ε this word is derived from cerno, I distinguish = (1)
judicia] decision, (2) a charge, accusation, (3 ) a crime. The
ssstigeaning is rare in ante-Augustan prose. Cf. IV.‚ 65, and

from pando, pandi, pansum, and passum, 3, to spread out.

alis : the winds are often represented by the Romans as having
wmgs.

gurgite: qurqes is connected with qula, the throat (cf. vorayo
and voro, to swallow) 3 generally means whjrlpool, eddy, but
also means stream, sea.

pisces: from piscis, -is, m.‚ one of the exceptions to the rule
that 3rd declension nouns ending in -is and not increasing in
genit. sing. are feminine; cf. funis and finis, ΙΧ., 13, and HL, 30.
