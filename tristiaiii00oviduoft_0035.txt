NOTE.

As Correspondence studente are generally ehildren of an older
growth, they do not care to have their names blazed abroad as pupils,
and we therefore refrain from publishing a list of references and
reprinting testimonials, of which we have hundreds of the most
laudatory kind. Many successful students have, nemrtheless, been so
kind as to offer to answer any¹ questions with regard to the College
which intending correspondents may care to put, and references to
these wil] be given to any who really wish for them.

We, morem-er, rest our claims to the student's confid÷nee on the eom-
parison which he can make for himself between our reprints of the Pass
Lists and those issued by the University; e.q., the last Intermediate
Arts and Matriculation Lists‚ in each of which he will find the names
of more than seventy 'University Gorrespondence College studente,
and the B.A., where over 15 per cent. of the whole list belong to ηε.

At the Matriculation Examination of Janumy, 1889, all other
Correspondence Classes together show only one success on the

University List.
