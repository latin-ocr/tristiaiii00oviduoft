’76 TmsTIA HL, xiv.

28. Euxini ε Euxinus comes from the Greek εὖ = well, and ξένος or
ξεῖνος, a sti-anger 3 hence εὕξενος or εὕξεινος = friendly to
sti-angers, hospitable, an epithet applied euphemistically to
the rough, stormy Black Sea. Similarly the cruel Furios were
called εὐμενίδες = the friendly or gracious ladies. The people
hoped to avoid the storms of the Euxine and the wrath of the
Furies by calling them respectively by a pleasant name. In
Tristia IV„ iv„ 55 ὣ 56, we read—

“ Frigida me cohibent Euxini frigora Ponti
Dictus ab antiquis Axenus ille f uit.''
Axenus = ἄξενος, from ἆ = not, and ξένος. So Eumenides
ought to have been Dysmenides (δυσμενίδες).

tho idea to look up at secretly, askance, hence to mistrust,
