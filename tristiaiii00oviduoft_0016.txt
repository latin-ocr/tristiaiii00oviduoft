Two Years' ocur-0 for tutor. Arta.

Although we do not recommend the average student to take two
years in preparation sor Inter. Arte, still there are some studente
whose time is so very limited that it is impossible to prepare in one
year. We have, therefore, made arrangements for studente to din·
tribute their work over more than a year. We prefer them to bev‘n
the last week in either September, J anuary, or April, on which latter
date we strongly recommend those who have reeently matriculated to
commence work. The fec for students joining in the Michaelmas
Term is increased by one guinea, and for those beginning in the Lent
Term by half-a-guinea‚ to compensate sor the extra pottage and the
longer time the papers are in use. In order to encourage ,Ianum-
Matrieulants to avoid rusting, and to work up during the term the
language not taken at Matn’culatiom no extra see is made for students
commencing aster Easter.
