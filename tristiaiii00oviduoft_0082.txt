46 Tms‘mA 111., iv.

-ι- κλίνω, to Zean). This passage expresses the same sentiment
as in Horace's aurea mediocritas, the golden mean.

1'7. hoc ipsum: the falling when the ground is level; as a rulo,
you can only fall from a height.

19. Elpenor: a companion of Ulysses, changed into a hog by Circe,
but afterwards restored. He met his death by falling from
the top of a house where he was sleeping.

20. regi: Ulysses, who, as narrated in the eleventh book of the
Odyssey, went down to the under world, and there saw the
shade of Elpenor.

debilis τ from ‹le and habilis = unmanageable‚ wanting in flexi-
bility‚ hence disabled, crippled, frail, feeble. The spirit is
called debilis because it is supposed to show the wonnds in-
fiieted on Elpenor when alive, hence it= mutilus, or mutilated.
There is another reading, flebilis = (1) to be wept over,
lamentable, (2) weeping‚ tearful.

21. agitaret . . . signet: The variation in tenses here is remark-
able, and to some extent irregular. There is another reading,

assitarit. The present siynet is probably used to express the
fact that the sea is still called Icarian.

Daedalus: a most ingenious Athenian artist, killed his nephew,
and was obliged on that account to flee with his son Icarus
to Crete. There he offended king Minos, and was confined
in the labyrinth‚ from which he escaped with his son by
making wings of feathers and wax. Icarus flew too near to
the sun, so that the wax on his wings melted and he fell into
the sea, which was from him called Iearian. Daedalus alighted
at Cumae and then went to Sicily, where the king put him to
death in order to avoid a war with king Minos.

23. hic . . . ille: the latter . . . the former. Hic = this here, the
oue nearest, i.e.‚ the latter 3 ille = that yonder, i.e., the former.

demissius: the comparative of the adv. demisse, from demissus,
-a, -wn, let down, low.

volabat: distinguish this word from volo, volui, velle, I wish.

24. The best way to translate this line is to take non suas together
as equivalent almost to alienas = wings which were not their
own, not natural. Another way is “for both did not keep
their wings,³⁷ i.e., the wings of Icarus melted.

Some editions read otum for ozam, and nonne for no‘n.

25. qui latuit = he who has lain hidden, i.e., has not made himself
intrusive.

26: quisque = each3 quisque can be used, as here, with the singular,
also with a plura-l verb, as Acz domum suam quisque ‘rediere =
they returned each to his own home 3 cf. supra, III. 67.
