METRE.

THE metre of this poem is elegiae, i.e., it consists of
alternate hexameter and pentameter lines. Each hexameter
consists of six feet. Each line consists of six feet3 each
foot is either a spondee or a dactyl. A spondee consists of
two long· syllables, e.g.‚ Ρὲηᾱὲηὲ. A dactyl consists of one
long syllable followed by two short syllables. e.g., 5302}ch

The fifth foot in a line is always a dactyl, and the last
foot a spondee3 or, to speak more accurately, the last foot
consists of two syllables, the former of which is always
long, and the latter either long or short.

The first four feet of the line can be either spondees 01·
dact ls.

Tge fifth foot is occasionally‚ though very rarely, a
spondee. There is an instance in Ovid, Met. XL, l. 93 :

orgia ξ tradlde Ι rat Η cum 1 Cecropi Ι ὀ Eu Ι molpo
and another in l. 456.
A caesura is a cutting up of a foot by the termination of
a word before the last syllable of the foot. Usually the
caesura falls in the third foot, after the first syllable ; but
it can fall after the second syllable of a dactyl, and it oc·
casionally occurs in the fourth foot instead of the third.
An instance of a caesura falling after the first syllable
of the third foot (the usual caesura, and called sto-0729
caesura) is given above.
An instance of a caesura falling after the second syllable
of a dactylic third foot (called a weak caesura) is
cuque chol ro meli! ore ΙΙ εὔὶἰ vilneta TIlmoli
An instance of the caesura in the fourth foot is
Herrenldas canit] amba! ges Η anltroque relmfigit
